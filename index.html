						<p>Welcome to the The co-curricular part of the website. It has been prepared to show boys and parents what is offered as part of the curriculum at The Doon School. The co-curriculum programme is a wide and critically important part of the education offered to each boy at school. In the words of the Headmaster ‘It is all curriculum’. He uses this phrase to explain why there is as much learning out of the classroom as in it and that learning in and out of the classroom are infact, mutually dependent upon the other.
						</p>
						<p>The school encourages boys joining in the D and C forms to develop their genuine interests and talents by getting involved with a wide range of activities and clubs on offer. By participating in these activities boys will be able to discover their interests, enjoy learning more about the activities and the skills required for these activities and, at the same time, they will make friends and have fun. </p>
						<p>Once the boys realize where their interests lie, the school will support them to develop their interests and pursue their talents. Tutors and Housemasters guide the boys in making choices and also in managing time, which is an important factor to keep in mind while making decisions about what to focus upon. The vast majority of boys have never had the opportunity to experience the full education that is on offer at The Doon School. All new D and new C form boys and their parents will be able to attend the Co-Curricular Fair to be held each year so that they get a better idea of the co-curricular programme on offer and are able to make suitable decisions for their boys.

						<p>Dear Fellow Doscos, <br/>
						It is a great honour and responsibility to chair the Board of Governors for the next five years. I’m grateful to members of the IPSS for asking me to succeed Gautam Thapar.
						</p>
						<p>The School has diligently implemented the Development Plan that was designed after much deliberation about eight years ago. For the coming years, we hope to continue this broad approach, and introduce some new initiatives.
						<br/><br/>
						In recent discussions, many of us have articulated the need to trigger a shift that will help India’s best school be counted amongst the best, anywhere in the world.
						<br/><br/>
						One of the major initiatives of the IPSS Board and the school will be to enhance the Doon School status as an ‘Elite’, needs-blind Institution, that seek to attract the best talent from around the country.  Simultaneously, the effort will be build a diverse pool of parents and guardians who send their wards to the school.
						<br/><br/>
						Cultivating this “more inclusive’’ image necessitates a substantial corpus. The earned income from the corpus should be enough to provide scholarships to assist those students and parents who are unable to pay the full school fee.  The fee, in the meantime, will continue to be pegged to cover the full cost of operating the school along with attendant costs.
						<br/>
						At the same time, the Doon School will continue to develop a vigorous admission process.  Among the planned new initiatives, there will be an effort to bring students from multiple regions and language backgrounds, and to develop an even stronger student exchange program.
